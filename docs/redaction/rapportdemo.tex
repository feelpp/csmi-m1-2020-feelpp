\section{The incomprehensible equations of Navier Stokes}
\begin{frame}
\textbf{definition}
Navier-Stokes equations are a system of nonlinear partial differential equations that describe the movement of fluids in a continuous medium.

\textbf{Reynolds number}
We will write the Navier-Stokes equation using dimensionless combinations (which
will be noted by premiums) of the different sizes involved. Let L and U be the scales
respective size and flow velocity, we have

There appears a dimensionless number, Re which is a combination of L, U and Î½: the number of
Reynolds. It weighs the term viscous diffusion against the other terms in the equation.
We recognize the two characteristic times necessary to transport the momentum
over a length L by diffusion and by convection. Transportation will be the shortest time
thus dominating the Reynolds number is the relationship between convective and diffusive effects:

It is also often useful to understand the Reynolds number as the relationship between the terms
of inertia and viscous forces of the Navier-Stokes equation
