= bundary conditions 

== continuity equation  

The time derivative can be understood as the accumulation (or loss) of mass in the system, while the divergence term represents the difference in flow in versus flow out

If the fluid is incompressible the mass continuity equation simplifies the volume continuity equation
and we have 

∇.u = 0

u is the flow velocity vector 

== momentum equation  

there are incoming or outgoing conditions specific to the Navier-Stokes system.

Indeed, as shown by the Chapman-Enskog method in the case of gases, the Navier-Stokes system supposes at the microscopic level a slight disturbance in the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, but this hypothesis is invalid in the vicinity of a wall.

V = 0 of a wall
T'= Tp at the wall, where Tp is the given wall temperature.

== energy  equation  

Here we have a initial condition 
 T(x,0) = f(x) ∀ x ∈ [0,L]
and boundary conditions, here of homogeneous Dirichlet type:
T(0,t) = 0 = T(L,t) ∀ t>0
