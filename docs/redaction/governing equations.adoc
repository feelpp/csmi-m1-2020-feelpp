= Governing equations of CFD

To solve a fluid mechanics problem, we use physical laws to find the mathematical equations which describe the physical properties of the fluid, such as velocity, temperature, pressure, density and viscosity. It is assumed that the fluid is incompressible, it means that the volume of the fluid cannot be reduced by an increase of pressure. Theses equations are called the governing equations of CFD, or the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations :

* Continuity equation :

Consider the fundamental principle of physics proposed by Antoine Lavoisier, +
which gives the intergral form of the mass conservation equation :

and, using the Gauss' divergence theorem, we obtain the differential form, +
which is the continuity equation :

where ρ (kg/m³) is the density and V (m/s) is the velocity.

* Momentum equation :

Newton’s second law states that the force of a moving object is equivalent to its rate of change of momentum. In fluid mechanics, the momentum theorem is :

and it was converted by the french mathematician Cauchy, with the application of divergence theorem, to differential form. The result is the momentum equation :

where P (Pa) is the pressure, μ (Pa.s) is the dynamic viscosity and g is the external forces acting on the fluid, such as gravity.

* Energy equation

where h (J) is the enthalpy, μₜ (Pa.s) is the turbulence viscosity, σₜ is a constant and Sₕ is the volumetric heat source.
