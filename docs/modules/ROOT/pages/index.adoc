=== Introduction

This part is the validation phase for <<Computational_Fluid_Dynamics,Computational Fluid Dynamics>> (<<Computational_Fluid_Dynamics,CFD>>) and <<Computational_Solid_Mechanics,Computational Solid Mechanics>> (<<Computational_Solid_Mechanics,CSM>>), it is where we check if we have solved the right problem by comparing our results to a database.

=== Context
==== Computational Fluid Dynamics

for *CFD* we constat that it supports both the incompressible Navier-Stokes and the Stokes equations. 
to do well the projet it will based on  properties namely *the density* and *viscosity* 
in finnaly we will not own the *Boundary Conditions*

==== Computational_Solid_Mechanics
it work properly with equations like  *Linear elasticity*
and *Hyper-elasticity* . we also can use Axisymmetric reduced model
