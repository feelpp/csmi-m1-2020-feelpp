=== Introduction

This part is the validation phase for <<Computational_Fluid_Dynamics,Computational Fluid Dynamics>> (<<Computational_Fluid_Dynamics,CFD>>) and <<Computational_Solid_Mechanics,Computational Solid Mechanics>> (<<Computational_Solid_Mechanics,CSM>>), it is where we check if we have solved the right problem by comparing our results to a database.
