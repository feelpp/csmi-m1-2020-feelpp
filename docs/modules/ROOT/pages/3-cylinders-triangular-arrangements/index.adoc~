= Flow around three cylinder in equilaterial triangular arrangements

NOTE: this benchmark is based on <<chen-2020>>.

== Presentation of the test case

=== Presentation
This study is based on the flow of a fluid in front of 3 circular and identical cylinders.
The cylinders are arranged in an equilateral rectangle, one of the cylinders is placed upstream and the other two side by side downstream.

In this test case, we are particularly interested in the effect of the spacing ratio L/D and the number of Reynolds Re on the flow, where L is the center-to-center spacing of the cylinder and D is the cylinder diameter.

The study is divided into 3 cases:

* study of the flow in front of an insulated cylinder such that stem:[Re \in [50,200]].

* study of the flow  in front of 2 cylinders side by side with Re=100 and L/D=2.5.

* study of the flow  in front of 3 cylinders with Re=100 and L/D=3.0.
