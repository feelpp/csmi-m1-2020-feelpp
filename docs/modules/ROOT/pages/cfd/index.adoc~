== What is a fluid ?

A fluid is a substance that flows (in other words, it takes the shape of its container) and does not resist to deformation (i.e. slips when moved). 
The terms fluid and liquid are often used interchangeably, but technically, the term fluid can refer to both a liquid and a gas. 

The distinction between liquids and gases can affect the way in which the fluid is modeled, but both have the same basic fluid formulae and comparable properties.

== Macroscopic properties of a fluid:

1. Dynamic viscosity: 

The viscosity of a fluid characterizes its resistance to speed of deformation (movement) caused by the application of a constraint (Force/surface). 

2. Compressibility: 

The ability of a fluid to undergo significant variations in density when applying a pressure step stem:[\dalta P] or a temperature variation stem:[\dalta T]. 

Two coefficients are used:

- isothermal compressibility coefficient: stem:[K_t]

- Coefficient of thermal expansion at constant pressure beta.

3. Thermal diffusion:

The quantity stem:[q=\frac{Q}{A}] is called heat flux density. It is a thermal power (Watts) exchanged per unit of surface area and is set: stem:[q=\frac{Q}{A}=-\lamda \frac{T1-T0{H}]. 

The positive number stem:[\lamda] is called the coefficient of thermal conductivity. It is expressed in W.m/K.

== Hierarchy of fluid flow equations: 

Computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) is one of the most quickly emerging ﬁelds in applied sciences.When computers were not mature enough to, from an overall perspective, CFD is more economical than experiments.

solve large numerical problems, two methods were used to solve ﬂuid
dynamics problems: analytical and experimental

Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be considered as a set of calculation methods for solving the equations governing fluid flow. 

In its application, the most important step is to be able to decide which set of physical assumptions and associated equations should be used, which highlights the hierarchy of flow equations solved with CFD.

Calculation methods can be:

- Conservation laws (CL)
- Continuum Conservation Legislation (CCL)
- Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations (C-NS)
- Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations (I-NS)
- Compressible Euler equations (EE)
- Weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations (WC-NS)
- Boussinesq's equations
- Ideal flow rate or potential flow equations
- Linearized compressible Euler equations (LEE)
- Sound wave or acoustic wave equation
- One-dimensional Euler equations or one-dimensional gas dynamics equations (1D-E)

== Methodology
To solve a CFD problem, we mainly go through three steps: 

1. Definition of a geometry and a mesh discretizing the computational domain and the numerical methods used. 

2. Numerical solution of the problem 

3. Exploitation of the results
