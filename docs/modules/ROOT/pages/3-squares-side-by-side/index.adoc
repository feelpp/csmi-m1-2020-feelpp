== Presentation of the test case

=== Presentation
This study is based on the flow of a fluid in front of three side-by-side square cylinders.
The cylinders are arranged side by side, the center of the central cylinder represents the origin of the coordinate system, one of the two other cylinders is placed below the central cylinder and the other above.

In this test case, we are particularly interested in the effect of the spacing ratio L/W on the flow, where L is the center-to-center spacing of the cylinder and W is the cylinder side width.

The numerical results obtained in this study will be compared with those found in the literature, for different gaps 
stem:[L/W < 1.4] and stem:[L/W \in [1.4,9]] with a Reynolds number equal to stem:[Re=150].

=== Geometry setting
The arrangement of the cylinders in the calculation area stem:[\Omega] is shown in the figure below :

We provide here the basic geometry used in Gmsh to describe stem:[\Omega].

The Data provided on the whole stem:[\Omega] domain allows us to have conditions at the specified limits, the table below summarize these data.

=== Boundary conditions
In this study 3 boundary conditions are imposed: Inlet condition, Outlet condition and the Wall condition.

* Inlet condition

On boundary (1) a Dirichlet-type condition is imposed and free-stream flow velocity is placed as an entry condition, it's defined by:

[stem]
++++
u = U \\
v = 0
++++

* Wall conditions 

On the limits (3), i.e. on the upper and lower wall we have :

[stem]
++++
\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{y}}=0\\
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{y}}=0\\
v=0
++++

.json configuration for the wall boundary condition

* Outlet condition

On boundary (2) (i.e the exit boundary condition) a Neumann-type condition is imposed

[stem]
++++
\frac{\partial{u}}{\partial{x}}=0\\
\frac{\partial{v}}{\partial{x}}=0\\
\frac{\partial{p}}{\partial{x}}=0
++++

We move on to meshing to generate fully structured uniform triangular cells, the figure below shows a part of the generated mesh:
