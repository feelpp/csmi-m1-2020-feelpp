== Presentation
This study will be based on laminar flow around a step laid in a flat channel. The fluid is subjected
to a sudden widening that causes an inverse pressure gradient, where the flow separates into several
zones, among which a recirculation zone is formed, noted stem:[x_r], where the flow closes to return to the
step.
The Reynolds number denoted Re for this flow is calculated from the channel height S, the
average flow velocity stem:[U_{ave}] and the kinematic viscosity v, and is defined by:

[stem]
++++
Re = \frac{SU_{ave}}{v}
++++

And as stem:[v=\frac{\mu}{\rho}] so:

[stem]
++++
Re = \frac{S\rho U_{ave}}{\mu}
++++

When the flow has low Reynolds number values, it is said to be stationary, while flows with higher
Reynolds number values become turbulent and the average length of the recirculation zone decreases
until a constant saturation value is reached. In this case, we are only interested in two different
Reynolds number values: `Re=389` and `Re=1095`.

== Geometry and data
The computational domain stem:[\Omega] is a channel with a descending step as shown in the figure below :

The Data provided on the whole stem:[\Omega] domain allows us to have conditions at the specified limits,
the tables below summarize these data.

== Boundary conditions

In this study 3 boundary conditions are imposed:

* Inlet condition

On boundary (1) a [bleu]#_Poiseuille_# [bleu]#_profile_# is placed as an entry condition, it is
defined by:

[stem]
++++
u = U_{int}= 6U_{ave}\frac{y_1}{H}(1-\frac{y_1}{H})
++++

such as stem:[y_1=y-S], and stem:[U_{ave}] are derived from the selected Reynolds number as:

[stem]
++++
U_{ave} = \frac{vRe}{S} = \frac{\mu Re}{\rho S}
++++

At the entrance the profile of Poiseuille is represented by the graphe below:

- For `Re=389`:

- For `Re=1095`:

- Wall conditions 

On the limits (2), i.e. on the upper and lower wall we have :
[stem]
++++
u=0
++++

* Outlet condition

On boundary (3) the exit boundary condition is [bleu]#_free_#, which means that no
constraint is imposed on the exit boundary.

== Conformal blocks division

To study the laminar flow around a backward Facing Step we have devised the geometry
in conformal blocks as the figure below illustrates:

== Mesh

After cutting our domain, we move on to meshing to generate fully structured uniform triangular
cells, the figure below shows a part of the generated mesh:

The study will be based on velocity profiles at different downstream locations, represented by
the different vertical lines stem:[x/S] for `Re = 389` and `Re = 1095`.
